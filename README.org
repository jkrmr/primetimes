* primetimes

  A command-line program to print a "times table" of prime numbers.

** Usage
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  primetimes % bin/primes-tables
  Usage: primes-table NUMBER_OF_PRIMES
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  primetimes % bin/primes-tables 10

** Performance
  The main operations are determining a given number's primality, and building a
  list of n primes. The former is implemented using optimized trial division
  (sub-linear asymptotic complexity), the latter, after some experimentation
  with caching and concurrency (more on that below), using brute force (linear
  time). Overall, sub-quadratic time.

  This doesn't scale, but on an older MacBook Pro gives decent results for N <
  1,000 and poor but tolerable performance for N < 10,000.

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  #                user     system      total        real
  # n: 10      0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001536)
  # n: 100     0.030000   0.000000   0.030000 (  0.033594)
  # n: 1000    1.620000   0.210000   1.830000 (  1.828361)
  # n: 10000 129.780000  14.240000 144.020000 (144.213969)
  #+END_SRC

** Implementation notes

  After some initial benchmarks I profiled the script and found that a
  significant proportion of the script's time was being spent on string
  construction:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  #   %   cumulative   total
  #  time   seconds   ms/call  name
  #  43.43   112.12      0.05  Primetimes::PrimesTablePrinter#row_string
  #  29.05   187.11     48.44  Array#map
  #+END_SRC

  So I experimented with caching and concurrency for this work. The former
  yielded some economy, the latter actually degraded performance:

  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  # lib/primetimes/primes_table_printer.rb L21-L29 (5e312196)

      def row_string(row)
        row.map do |cell|
          unless cell_string[cell]
            cell_string[cell] = cell.to_s.rjust(max_product_length)
          end

          cell_string[cell]
        end
      end
  #+END_SRC

  There are other operations that are parallelizable, but I saw the same results
  there as well--the cost of thread creation evidently dominates in this case.

  Another experiment was with storing a list of primes as JSON and loading it,
  in theory providing constant-time list generation for N up to the length of
  the list. File I/O degraded performance significantly, though.
